A TUAS Frontend course project to learn CI/CD environments. GitHub Actions were used for this project.
Deployed is a frontend-only app, namely the default that ships with Vite + React + Javascript, but with
some added tests.

GitHub Actions workflows cover testing, linting, build, deployment, and also listening to issues.

Make sure that you have Node installed (we recommend [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)) and then install requirements:

```bash
$ npm i
```


## Usage

```bash
